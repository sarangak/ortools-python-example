# A [Zebra Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) Solver using OR-Tools

## Motivation

There are a number of options for solving these programmatically, but I found [or-tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/python) in Python to be a good choice. I couldn't find a good Python 3 example for this on the Internet, so here is my shot at one.

## Usage

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
2. `poetry install --no-root`
3. `poetry run solver`
